# Assignment-2a
The topic of my project is cat stocking system. I just wanted to make a kind of system which could differentiate easily between two most important things while running a business. First is from where you are getting the stock. Second is what you have in your inventory to offer to the buyers. This was my main motive of creating this system and I used foreign-key relation here to describe the similarity between two tables which is just for my use. Because the buyers won't be willing to know the details about the previous owner if the dealer is assuring them. So that is just needed to me in case something happens with the car, atleast I would know from where it came and what to do One table is Supplier and other is Stock which are as descriptive as it could be. I have added some comments in my scripts because most of the stuff is done by scaffolding to develop the CRUD functionality in my application. Rest is some designing and other sort of things.
Also now we have to use Identity.sql query to add the aspnet tables into our own database where we will store the information that we would use while running our project like users.
Also I have done the google authentication part successfully to link the user google account for:-
Since, the user can only create, edit or delete when the user is authenticated so that requires an account to be signed up.
Also I have created marie@gc.ca account as per the requirement.
